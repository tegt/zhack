Warning there be hackish things herein. This environment moves some
common scripts (php and bash), and many .file defaults among linux
systems.

It's a personal convenience but not likely a design pattern you would
not want to follow.

The form may be useful but no documentation is presented by intent. In
essence the Makefile sym-links many defaults into the home
directory. The emacs scripts can be sym-linked from reserve for
systems that don't already have better.
